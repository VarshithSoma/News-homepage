I made a static website utilizing Google Fonts for custom typography, CSS for style, and HTML for structure. Flexbox and grid were utilized for layout, pseudo-classes were used to provide interaction, and CSS media queries made it responsive. The aesthetic appeal was increased by custom CSS variables and transitions, while accessibility  were improved by semantic HTML components.
